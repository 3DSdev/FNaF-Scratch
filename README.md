# FNaF Scratch port
A Five Nights at Freddy's port in Scratch

Built with TurboWarp by GarboMuffin, and using the HD images upload addon by ErrorGamer2000, GarboMuffin, World_Languages, and SheepTester.

This is a very resource-intensive project! Because I'm using HD images with little to no compression, the file sizes increase by a lot! Make sure you have some good RAM or have no other tabs or applications open before playing this. I'd say 4-8 GB of RAM would be ideal.
