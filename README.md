# FNaF Scratch port
A Five Nights at Freddy's port in Scratch in 16:9!

Built with TurboWarp by GarboMuffin, and using the HD images upload addon by ErrorGamer2000, GarboMuffin, World_Languages, and SheepTester.

Notes for running the .SB3:
This is a very resource-intensive project! Because I'm using HD images with little to no compression, the file sizes increase by a lot! Make sure you have some good RAM or have no other tabs or applications open before playing this. I'd say 4-8 GB of RAM would be ideal. Right now the SB3 file size is 11 MB.

Running this game packaged will be much less laggy and will probably run very smoothly.
